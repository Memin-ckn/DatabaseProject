This is a website project for my internship at SESA Plastic Packaging. I am accessing a test SQL Server that has over 120 thousand rows and over 50 columns.
This website lets a 'customer' with a unique customer username register and login into a dashboard where they can see their orders in detail.
The code may or may not have many flaws or room for improvement. I have just started learning these languages and resources that I have used in this project and I am improving my code as I go.
